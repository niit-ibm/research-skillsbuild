## 🩺 Five Workforce Pillars of AI-Augmented Roles

| **Pillar** | **Description** | **Example Roles** |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 🧾 **Administrative** | Streamlining operations, compliance, and revenue optimization across non-clinical processes. | *Revenue Cycle Analyst, CDI Co-Pilot, Compliance Automation Specialist* |
| ❤️ **Patient Experience & Risk Cover** | Enhancing patient engagement, claims efficiency, and personalized care journeys. | *AI Claims Auditor, Virtual Health Concierge, Predictive Underwriter* |
| ⚙️ **Technology & Infrastructure** | Building interoperable data systems, automation, and AI governance layers. | *IoMT Engineer, Data Steward, AI Governance Lead* |
| 🧬 **Research** | Driving AI-enabled R&D, trials, and health data analytics. | *Drug Discovery Modeler, Trial Data Curator, Pharmacovigilance Analyst* |
| 🚀 **Strategy & Growth** | Defining AI adoption strategy, innovation, and organizational transformation. | *AI Transformation Lead, Product Innovation Manager* |

> **Insight:**  
> These pillars align with IBM IBV (2025) findings that non-clinical AI adoption will outpace clinical automation, particularly in operations and compliance domains.
